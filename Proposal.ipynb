    "Introduction:\n",
    "Cardiovascular diseases, which kill approximately 17 million people in the world, include heart attacks, heart strokes, and heart failure. Heart failure is caused when the heart cannot successfully send the required amount of blood to the body (Chicco, 2020). In this project, we will predict what factors determine whether patients can survive after heart failure. We will use dataset \"https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/00519/heart_failure_clinical_records_dataset.csv\", which collects the data of 299 patients after heart failure at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad during April to December 2015. \n"
