    "    Cardiovascular diseases kill approximately 17 million people in the world, including heart attacks, strokes, and heart failure. In particular, heart failure is caused when the heart cannot successfully send the required amount of blood to the body (Chicco, 2020), and can occur for numerous reasons such as diabetes, high blood pressure, and other heart conditions or diseases. With the emergence and accessibility of electronic health records, it is now possible to use data from patients who have experienced heart failure and find trends and patterns amongst variables that could be possible predictors for people who are at risk of heart failure. Due to the vital nature of the heart finding trends among variables as predictors of heart failure has become a priority among doctors and researchers alike. Our project was to take a data set comprised of data taken from people who had suffered from heart failure and build a classifying model that could predict a person's chance of survival after heart failure. A data set collected at the Faisalabad Institute of Cardiology and at the Allied Hospital in Faisalabad contains the data of 299 patients which consisted of 105 women and 194 men who had all experienced heart failure. The dataset contained 13 features which ranged from physical, clinical, and lifestyle characteristics. This included categorical variables like sex, diabetes, and smoking; as well as numerical variables such as platelet count, serum creatine levels, and ejection fraction. This data set also contained the information on whether the patient had died in the 130 days follow-up after their heart failure referred to as a death event. Through the use of forward selection, we were able to identify two variables that were strong predictors of death events. These two variables, serum creatine and ejection fraction were used to build our classifying model that would take in the values of our predictors and classify whether this patient would experience a death event or not. This classifier would allow us to answer the question of if given a person's serum creatine levels and ejection fraction will that person survive within 130 days after their heart failure?\n"
